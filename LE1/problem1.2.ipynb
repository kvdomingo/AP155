    "<b>Problem 1.2: The Madelung constant</b><br />\n",
    "In condensed matter physics the Madelung constant gives the total electric potential felt by an atom in a solid. It depends on the charges on the other atoms nearby and their locations. Consider for instance solid sodium chloride—table salt. The sodium chloride crystal has atoms arranged on a cubic lattice, but with alternating sodium and chlorine atoms, the sodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the chlorine ones a single negative charge $−e$, where $e$ is the charge on the electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer coordinates $(i, j, k)$, then the sodium atoms fall at positions where $i + j + k$ is even, and the chlorine atoms at positions where $i + j + k$ is odd. Consider a sodium atom at the origin, $i = j = k = 0$, and let us calculate the Madelung constant. If the spacing of atoms on the lattice is $a$, then the distance from the origin to the atom at position $(i, j, k)$ is\n",

    "    \\sqrt{(ia)^2+(ja)^2+(ka)^2} = a\\sqrt{i^2+j^2+k^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the potential at the origin created by such an atom is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    V(i,j,k) = \\pm \\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0a\\sqrt{i^2+j^2+k^2}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\epsilon_0$ being the permittivity of the vacuum and the sign of the expression depending on whether $i + j + k$ is even or odd. The total potential felt by the sodium atom is then the sum of this quantity over all other atoms. Let us assume a cubic box around the sodium at the origin, with $L$ atoms in all directions. Then\n",

    "    V_{total} = \\sum_{i,j,k = -L}^{L} V(i,j,k) = \\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0a}M\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the Madelung constant, at least approximately — technically the Madelung constant is the value of $M$ when $L \\rightarrow \\infty$, but one can get a good approximation just by using a large value of $L$. Write a program to calculate and print the Madelung constant for sodium chloride. Use as large a value of $L$ as you can, while still having your program run in reasonable time — say in a minute or less."
